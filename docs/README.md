![logo](icon64.png)

Grey is a minimalistic, blazing fast, disposable, cross-platform, zero configuration UI library for C++ and C# that frees up developers' grey matter to do something that matters.

Grey is designed to display user interface in one line of code with no ceremony at all.

It's based on the awesome [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) framework and follows it's design principles.

## Features

- Cross-platform - currently supports **Windows x64** and **Linux x64**.
- Supports High DPI out of the box.
- Looks beautiful by default.
- Completely stateless i.e. no widgets, state synchronisation and so on.
